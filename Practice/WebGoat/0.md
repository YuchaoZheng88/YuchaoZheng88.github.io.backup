### SQL injection 
1. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

    `SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT`
    
    `SELECT * FROM [table_name] WHERE [column_name]=[value];`
    
    `UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name]=[value] WHERE [another_column_name]=[value];`

2. Data Definition Language (DDL)

    `CREATE, ALTER, DROP`
    
    `ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD [new_column_name] [data_type];`

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
    
    `GRANT, REVOKE`
    
    `GRANT ALL ON [table_name] to [user_name];`
    
    `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON [table_name] to [user_name];`

4. SQL Injection
    
    Server
    `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '[user_input]';`
    
    Injections
    
    `Bob' or '1'='1`
    
    `Bob' or 1=1; --`   
    
    `Bob'; DROP TABLE users; TRUNCATE audit_log; --`

5. SQL JOIN

    Combine rows from multiple tables.
    - `SELECT [table_A].[column_x], [table_B].[column_y] FROM [table_A] INNER JOIN [table_B] ON [table_A].[column_id] = [table_B].[column_id]`
    
    - JOIN: information on both tables.
    - INNER JOIN: IDs(the id row) of the Intersection of the common IDs. (no NULL if origin tables have no NULL)
    - LEFT JOIN: IDs of the table_A. (with information on table_B if it has the id, or filled with NULL)
    - RIGHT JOIN: IDs of the table_B. (with information on table_A if it has the id, or filled with NULL)
    - FULL JOIN: IDs of the both tables. (combine of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN)

6. Blind SQL Injection

    ```
       Normal request
       https://my-shop.com?article=4
       Test request
       https://my-shop.com?article=4 AND 1=1
       If response is same, the server takes "AND 1=1" as code.
       So it is vulnerable.
       Exploit
       https://my-shop.com?article=4 AND substring(database_version(),1,1) = 2
       try out the database version even dump the database.
    ```
    
    ```
    Time based
    article=4; sleep(10 --)
    When ture and false`s return are same, we can use time to diffirentiate them.
    ```

### Authentication Flaws 
1. Secure Password

2. Password Reset

3. Authentication bypasses

   - [link](https://pvxs.medium.com/webgoat-authentication-bypass-2-4eeb8e8b502b)
    
4. JWT tokens

### Access Control Flaws
1. Insecure direct object references

    ```
    ```

2. Missing function level access control

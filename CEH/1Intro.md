## TTPs
Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

## Adversary Behaviors
- Internal Reconnaissance
- Use of Powershell
- Unspecified Proxy Activities
- Use of Command-Line Interface
- HTTP User Agent
- Command and Control Server
- User of DNS Tunnelling
- Use of Web Shell
- Data Staging

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Unusual outbound network traffic 
- Unusual activity through a privileged user account 
- Geographical anomalies 
- Multiple login failures 
- Increased database read volume 
- Large HTML response size 
- Multiple requests for the same file 
- Mismatched port-application traffic 
- Suspicious registry or system file changes 
- Unusual DNS requests 
- Unexpected patching of systems 
- Signs of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) activity 
- Bundles of data in the wrong places 
- Web traffic with superhuman behavior

## Hacking phases
- Reconnaissance
- Scanning
- Gain Access
- Maintaining Access
- Clearing Tracks

## Defense in Depth

2. Physical
3. Perimeter
4. Internal Network
5. Host
6. Application
7. Data

## Machine Learning:
1. Supervised:\
  Supervised learning uses algorithms that input a set of labeled training data to attempt to learn the differences between the given labels. Supervised learning is further divided into two subcategories, namely, **classification** and **regression**.\
  Classification includes completely divided classes. Its main task is to define the test sample to identify its class. Regression is used when data classes are not separated, such as when the data is continuous.
  
2. Unsupervised:\
  Unsupervised learning makes use of algorithms that input unlabeled training data to attempt to deduce all the categories without guidance. Unsupervised learning is further divided into two subcategories, namely, **clustering** and **dimensionality reduction**. Clustering divides the data into clusters based on their similarities, regardless of class information. Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the dimensions (attributes) of data.

# Module 20: Cryptography

- Generate hashes and checksum files
- Calculate the encrypted value of the selected file
- Use encrypting/decrypting techniques
- Perform file and data encryption
- Create self-signed certificates
- Perform email encryption
- Perform disk encryption
- Perform cryptanalysis

## Encrypt the Information using Various Cryptography Tools

### Calculate One-way Hashes using HashCalc
  Message digest (One-way Hash)
  - If any given bit of the functionâ€™s input is changed, every output bit has a 50% chance of changing.

  supports the Secure Hash Algorithm family: 
  - MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA2 (SHA256, SHA384, SHA512), 
  - RIPEMD160, PANAMA, TIGER, CRC32, ADLER32, 
  - The hash used in the peer-to-peer file sharing applications, eDonkey and eMule.

### Calculate MD5 Hashes using MD5 Calculator

### Calculate MD5 Hashes using HashMyFiles

### Other tools
  - MD6 Hash Generator (https://www.browserling.com), 
  - All Hash Generator (https://www.browserling.com), 
  - MD6 Hash Generator (https://convert-tool.com), and 
  - md5 hash calculator (https://onlinehashtools.com) 

## Perform File and Text Message Encryption using CryptoForge
  protect the privacy of sensitive files, folders, or email messages by encrypting.\
  Once the information has been encrypted, it can be stored on insecure media or transmitted on an insecure network.

# Module 20: Cryptography

- Generate hashes and checksum files
- Calculate the encrypted value of the selected file
- Use encrypting/decrypting techniques
- Perform file and data encryption
- Create self-signed certificates
- Perform email encryption
- Perform disk encryption
- Perform cryptanalysis

## Encrypt the Information using Various Cryptography Tools

### Calculate One-way Hashes using HashCalc
  Message digest (One-way Hash)
  - If any given bit of the functionâ€™s input is changed, every output bit has a 50% chance of changing.

  supports the Secure Hash Algorithm family: 
  - MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA2 (SHA256, SHA384, SHA512), 
  - RIPEMD160, PANAMA, TIGER, CRC32, ADLER32, 
  - The hash used in the peer-to-peer file sharing applications, eDonkey and eMule.

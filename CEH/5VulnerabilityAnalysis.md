# Vulnerability Analysis

vulnerability research:
  - Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
  - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  - National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
	
Vulnerability Assessment:
  - OpenVAS
  - Nessus
  - GFI LanGuard
  - CGI Scanner Nikto

  using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP):
  - Base Score: The metric most relied upon by enterprises and deals with the inherent qualities of a vulnerability. The table below describes the severity of a vulnerability depending upon the Base Score range:
  - Temporal Score: Represents the qualities of the vulnerability that change over time, and the Environmental score represents the qualities of the vulnerability that are specific to the affected user's environment.
  - Search for vulnerabilities.

## Lab 2: Perform Vulnerability Assessment using Various Vulnerability Assessment Tools

### Perform Web Servers and Applications Vulnerability Scanning using CGI Scanner Nikto
  ``` nikto -H ```
  - A tuning scan can be used to decrease the number of tests performed against a target. By specifying the type of test to include or exclude, faster and focused testing can be completed. This is useful in situations where the presence of certain file types such as XSS or simply “interesting” files is undesired.

  ``` nikto -h www.certifiedhacker.com -Tuning x ```
  - -h: specifies the target host. 
  - x: specifies the Reverse Tuning Options (i.e., include all except specified).

  ``` nikto -h www.certifiedhacker.com -Cgidirs all ```
  - -Cgidirs: scans the specified CGI directories; 
  - users can use filters such as “none” or “all” to scan all CGI directories or none).

  ``` nikto -h (Target Website) -o (File_Name) -F txt ```
  - -o: specifies the name of the output file.
  - -F: specifies the file format.

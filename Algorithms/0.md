  ```
  undirected graph
  BFS is better than DFS: DFS may be very deep in memory; while BFS`s neighbors queue will be poped during the process. So it wont take so much memory as DFS.
  DFS will remember all the former elements, BFS will only remember the perimeter elements.

  Another method Union Find (aka Disjoint Set)

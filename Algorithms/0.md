  ```
  Method 1, not a method, just use the data structure in the language
  Python OrderedDict; Java LinkedHashMap

  class LRUCache extends LinkedHashMap<Integer, Integer>
  public LRUCache(int capacity) {
          super(capacity, 0.75F, true); 
         // 75% auto increase, 
         //true for last access order, false for insertion order
          this.capacity = capacity;}

## Number of Islands
  No:200
  [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
  
  ```
  undirected graph
  BFS is better than DFS: DFS may be very deep in memory; while BFS`s neighbors queue will be poped during the process. So it wont take so much memory as DFS.
  DFS will remember all the former elements, BFS will only remember the perimeter elements.

  Another method Union Find (aka Disjoint Set)
